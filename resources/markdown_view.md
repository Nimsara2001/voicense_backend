**Lecture Notes on Quantum Mechanics**

## Introduction

* Quantum mechanics: study of the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level
* Key principles: wave-particle duality, superposition, and uncertainty

## Wave-Particle Duality

* De Broglie's hypothesis: particles have wave-like properties
* Wavelength of a particle: λ = h/p
* Double-slit experiment: demonstrates both particle and wave properties of electrons

## Superposition

* Quantum state: set of all possible states that a system can be in
* Superposition: system can be in multiple states simultaneously until measured
* Schrödinger's equation: describes the evolution of a quantum state over time

## Uncertainty Principle

* Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: ΔxΔp ≥ h/4π
* Cannot simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with arbitrary precision

## Quantum States

* Quantum state represented by a wave function: Ψ(x,t)
* Wave function: contains all information about the state
* Probabilistic interpretation: |Ψ(x,t)|² gives the probability of finding the particle at position x at time t

## Operators

* Operators: mathematical objects that act on wave functions
* Position operator: x
* Momentum operator: p = -iħ(d/dx)
* Energy operator: H = -(ħ²/2m)d²/dx²

## Energy Levels

* Eigenvalues of the energy operator: discrete energy levels
* Ground state: lowest energy level
* Excited states: higher energy levels

## Quantum Transitions

* Transitions between energy levels occur through the emission or absorption of photons
* Energy of photon: E = hf
* Selection rules: govern which transitions are allowed

## Spin

* Intrinsic angular momentum of particles
* Spin quantum number: s = ±1/2
* Pauli exclusion principle: no two electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers (n, l, m, s)

## Hydrogen Atom

* Simplest atom
* Electron orbitals: described by quantum numbers (n, l, m, s)
* Energy levels: given by the formula E = -13.6 eV/n²
